SQL for Business Analyst PortfolioThis repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to solve real-world business problems across various domains like sales, customer behavior, and product performance. Developed for a Business Analyst role, this project demonstrates proficiency in advanced SQL techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, Subqueries, Self-Joins, and complex aggregations, all aimed at extracting actionable insights from transactional and dimensional data.Database SchemaThis project utilizes a foundational e-commerce database schema comprising three tables:gold_dim_customersContains customer demographic information.|| Column | Type | Description || customer_key | INT | Unique identifier for customer || customer_id | INT | Public-facing customer ID || customer_number | VARCHAR | Alphanumeric customer identifier || first_name | VARCHAR | Customer's first name || last_name | VARCHAR | Customer's last name || country | VARCHAR | Customer's country of residence || marital_status | VARCHAR | Customer's marital status || gender | VARCHAR | Customer's gender || birthdate | DATE | Customer's date of birth || create_date | DATE | Date customer account was created (acquisition) |gold_dim_productsContains product details.| Column | Type | Description || product_key | INT | Unique identifier for product || product_id | INT | Public-facing product ID || product_number | VARCHAR | Alphanumeric product identifier || product_name | VARCHAR | Name of the product || category_id | VARCHAR | Identifier for the product category || category | VARCHAR | Broad product category (e.g., 'Electronics') || subcategory | VARCHAR | Specific product subcategory (e.g., 'Laptops') || maintenance | VARCHAR | Maintenance information (e.g., 'Low', 'High') || cost | INT | Manufacturing or acquisition cost of the product || product_line | VARCHAR | Product line (e.g., 'Premium', 'Basic') || start_date | DATE | Date product became available |gold_fact_salesContains sales transaction data.| Column | Type | Description || order_number | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for each order || product_key | INT | Foreign key linking to gold_dim_products || customer_key | INT | Foreign key linking to gold_dim_customers || order_date | DATE | Date the order was placed || shipping_date | DATE | Date the order was shipped || due_date | DATE | Due date for payment || sales_amount | INT | Sales amount for the line item/product in the order || quantity | TINYINT | Quantity of the product sold in the line item |Key Business Problems & SQL SolutionsThis section highlights a selection of the most impactful SQL queries in this repository, showcasing diverse analytical challenges and the SQL techniques used to solve them.1. Customer Loyalty Tier Migration AnalysisBusiness Question: How do customers move between loyalty tiers based on their annual spend?Insight: Identified customers who upgraded or downgraded loyalty tiers year-over-year, crucial for informing targeted marketing and retention strategies.SQL Skills: CTE, LAG(), CASE WHEN, Window Functions (PARTITION BY, ORDER BY), DATE_FORMAT(), YEAR(), SUM(), GROUP BY.Code: sql_queries/customer_analysis/Q27_Customer_Loyalty_Tier_Migration.sql2. Average Order Value by Product Category over Customer Lifespan QuartilesBusiness Question: Do customer purchasing behaviors in specific product categories vary based on their tenure with the company?Insight: Segmented customers into lifespan quartiles (NTILE()) and then calculated the average order value for each product category within these segments, providing deep strategic insights for product development and personalized offerings.SQL Skills: CTE, NTILE(), DATEDIFF(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG(), GROUP BY, JOIN.Code: sql_queries/customer_analysis/Q30_Avg_Order_Value_Lifespan_Quartiles.sql3. Product Co-Purchasing (Market Basket Analysis)Business Question: Which products are most frequently purchased together in the same order?Insight: Identified the top 10 pairs of products commonly bought in the same transaction, directly informing cross-selling strategies, product bundling, and merchandising layouts.SQL Skills: CTE, Self-JOIN on a fact table, COUNT(*), GROUP BY, WHERE (for unique pair ordering), ORDER BY, LIMIT.Code: sql_queries/product_analysis/Product_Co_Purchasing_Market_Basket_Analysis.sql4. Products with Sales Decrease from Previous QuarterBusiness Question: Product management needs to quickly spot products experiencing a decline in sales.Insight: Identified products where the total sales amount in a quarter was lower than the immediately preceding quarter, enabling proactive inventory adjustments and targeted marketing interventions.SQL Skills: CTE, LAG(), QUARTER(), YEAR(), SUM(), GROUP BY, Window Functions, WHERE, CASE WHEN (for handling growth/decline categories).Code: sql_queries/product_analysis/Q24_Products_Sales_Decrease_Prev_Quarter.sql5. Identifying Top 5 Product Categories by Growth in Latest QuarterBusiness Question: The executive team is looking for high-growth areas within the product portfolio.Insight: Identified the top 5 product categories with the highest sales growth percentage from the second-to-last quarter to the latest full quarter, guiding strategic investment decisions.SQL Skills: CTE, LAG(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM(), GROUP BY, Window Functions, CASE WHEN (for division-by-zero handling), ORDER BY, LIMIT.Code: sql_queries/product_analysis/Q26_Top_5_Product_Categories_Growth.sql6. Products with Sales SpikesBusiness Question: The supply chain team needs to identify products with unusually high sales on a specific day compared to their average daily sales.Insight: Found products and order dates where daily sales were more than 3 times their overall average daily sales, crucial for demand forecasting and inventory anomaly detection.SQL Skills: Subquery, AVG(), SUM(), GROUP BY, JOIN, WHERE (for thresholding).Code: sql_queries/product_analysis/Q28_Products_With_Sales_Spikes.sql7. Employee Performance Ranking (Sales Rep Stand-in)Business Question: Sales management wants to rank sales representatives by their total sales each month and compare their rank to the total sales of their country.Insight: Provided detailed monthly performance rankings for sales representatives, both individually and relative to their regional performance, aiding in performance evaluation and goal setting.SQL Skills: CTE, RANK(), SUM() OVER (for broader aggregation), PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, DATE_FORMAT().Code: sql_queries/sales_performance/Q29_Employee_Performance_Ranking.sql8. Average Time Between Orders for Each CustomerBusiness Question: Customer experience wants to understand typical repurchase intervals.Insight: Calculated the average number of days between consecutive orders for each customer, informing re-engagement campaigns and customer journey mapping.SQL Skills: CTE, LAG(), DATEDIFF(), AVG(), Window Functions, GROUP BY, JOIN.Code: sql_queries/customer_analysis/Q25_Avg_Time_Between_Orders.sql9. Cumulative Sales by Product Category Over TimeBusiness Question: Finance needs to monitor the cumulative sales performance of each product category throughout the year.Insight: Provided a running total of sales for each product category month-over-month, essential for tracking progress against targets and financial forecasting.SQL Skills: CTE, SUM() OVER, DATE_FORMAT(), GROUP BY, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY.Code: sql_queries/sales_reporting/Q23_Cumulative_Sales_By_Category.sql10.
